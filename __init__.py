    ComfyUI may import this node pack under a generated package name derived
    from the custom-node directory. A relative fallback import would then give
    the inner package that generated name too. Aliasing only the package object
    as ``h3_optimizations`` is insufficient because its ``__spec__`` still
    points at the generated name, so later relative imports can load sibling
    modules twice under different names. Class identity checks then fail even
    though both classes came from the same source file.

    Load the package as ``h3_optimizations`` from the start instead. Every
    relative import inside the package then resolves through the same namespace.
